# zmk-config-corne
A repo for building the zmk firmware for my corne keyboard. Uses github actions
instead of relying on a local build environment. See [zmk.dev](https://zmk.dev/)
for how-to information and [https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/key-press](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/key-press)
for keymap information.
